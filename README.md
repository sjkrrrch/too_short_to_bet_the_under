# Life's Too Short to Bet the Under
## Predicting Overs in the NBA
This was a project I did for my Statistical Modeling class with Dr. Daniel Biles. I also presented it at BURS -  Belmont University Research Symposium.
The code is definitely not the most organized but I have it attached as well as the Powerpoint I presented. Any constructive feedback is greatly appreciated!
